# CO650 - An Network Architecture Study Guide

While my main Goal for this repo are the following:

1. Understand and simplify how the Network or (INTERNET - protocols work) to create an simply "API"
2. Help others like understand the relevant tools, Reading materials, and Coding guides.
3. The Main languages used while C/C++17.
	- While newer std are available out-there; Large majority of code-bases to my knowledge use std=11 or std=17 as the "newest"
	- Linux will not be supported until i have an stronger understanding but i will entertain the idea at a later date
